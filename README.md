# Habitology
Objective:

The aim of this project is to build an app that will allow the users to keep a check on their habits on a day-to-today basis. In today’s world everyone has a busy schedule and doesn't get time to focus on their habits. This app can remind users what activities to do each day. The key point is that the habitology provides immediate evidence that you have completed your activity. It is motivating to see the progress you are making and you don’t want to break your streak. The app will help in keeping track of your steps and you can create your own list of habits. Tracking habits can be stressful but this app helps motivate people to continue their streak by giving a visual representation of completed tasks. Methodologies used to make the app are Flutter, Dart programming language and Hive Flutter Database.

Scope:

1.     User Registration and Login: The app provides a user registration and login system so that users can create and access their own accounts.
2.     Habit Tracking: The app allows user to add habits that they want to track, including the name of the habit. Users should be able to track their progress towards completing their habits over time.
3.     Habit Reminders and Notifications: The app should provide users with reminders and notifications at set intervals to remind them to complete their habits.
4.     Data Visualization: The app includes a data visualization tool that allows users to view their progress towards completing their habits over time, which is a heatmap calendar.


Proposed Methodology:


For the habitology, Flutter is used. Apps built with Flutter are largely indistinguishable from those built using the Android SDK, both in terms of looks and performance. Running at 60 fps, user interfaces created with Flutter perform far better than those created with other cross-platform development frameworks such as React Native and Ionic.


Reasons to use flutter: 


Flutter uses Dart, a fast, object-oriented language with several useful features such as mix-ins, generics, isolates, and optional static types.


1. Flutter has its own UI components, along with an engine to render them on both the Android and iOS platforms. Most of those UI components, right out of the box, conform to the guidelines of Material Design.
2. Flutter apps can be developed using IntelliJ IDEA, an IDE that is very similar to Android Studio.  




Results and Conclusion:


The habitology is created using the flutter framework. Flutter is an open-source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. It is created using Dart programming language which is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. The habitology created using Flutter based framework provides a simple UI which is easy to use. It is not as complicated as other existing apps that have a huge amount of information which may be too overwhelming for the user to focus on. This app helps the user to focus on their habits and shows the progress of the user which motivates them to continue their progress.


This app reminds users what activities to do each day. The key point is that this habit tracker app provides immediate evidence that you have completed your activity. It motivates us to see the progress we are making and as we don’t want to break the streak. The app helps in keeping track of the user's steps and users can create their own list of habits. Tracking habits can be stressful but this app helps motivate people to continue their streak by giving a visual representation of completed tasks.
